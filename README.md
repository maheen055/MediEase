# MediEase

MediEase is a transformative project designed to enhance the lives of older individuals and those with health impairments, particularly those affected by arthritis. With a commitment to addressing the specific challenges faced by this demographic, MediEase introduces a Medication Dispensing Machine that offers convenience, accuracy, and reliability in managing medication regimens.

With an aging population in the Peel region, where nearly half of adults aged 65+ suffer from arthritis, there is a pressing need for a solution that simplifies the often cumbersome task of opening medication bottles. MediEase not only meets this need but also goes above and beyond.

The project's client/customer definition is clear, targeting seniors aged 65-84, who number approximately 33,135 in the region. Competitive analysis reveals that existing solutions lack certain critical features such as smart reminders and automated medication management.

MediEase adheres to rigorous requirement specifications, including audible and visual reminders, quick response time, and ample pill storage capacity. The project incorporates scientific and mathematical principles to optimize its design and relies on reliable components from globally recognized manufacturers.

Furthermore, a comprehensive installation manual and user guide ensure that caregivers and users can easily set up and operate the Medication Dispensing Machine. The project considers energy efficiency, adheres to power limits, and undergoes thorough risk analysis and testing to guarantee safety and functionality.

MediEase emerges as a beacon of hope for older individuals and those with health impairments, offering a solution that promises to simplify their lives, promote independence, and ensure accurate and timely medication management.
